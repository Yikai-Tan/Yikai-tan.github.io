                        <h2>2nd Place</h2>
                        <p>During 2022, the Covid 19 restrictions hindered our time practising together. We still practised together and came on days where possible to refine the songs we were playing while abiding by the safe distancing measures. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into how to play a guitar in an ensemble and how to follow the conductor and ensemble through the zoom window that had some latency. Although my hand hurt very badly after a full day of practice, this did not stop me or my friends from persevering and continuing to practice for this competition. In the process, this experience forged closer bonds between me and my ensemble mates. Even though we received placed 2nd for the effort we put in, we still felt accomplished.</p>

                        <p>In 2023, together with my CCA mates, we went to represent the school at SYF. From this experience, we forged closer bonds amongst the cca. As a Section Leader, I led my section and guided the juniors by teaching them how to play the songs and giving them tips on following the ensemble and conductor. As a CCA, after much hard work was put into practising the pieces we presented on the day of SYF, we clenched a distinction award at SYF in 2023.</p>
