                    <h2>Project Context</h2>
                    <p>MultiLingo strives to break the language barriers that we have today between people. Using the industry's most trusted and pioneer model from Open AI, Chat GPT 3.5, we made an application that translates language to language and teaches users simple phrases to simplify the travelling process.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>From this project, I learned how to tap into Large Language Models (LLMs) and harness their strengths in language processing. In this process, I also learned how to create a bash file for users to install the required libraries for the application to run. My group and I encountered various issues during the project, such as the LLM generating gibberish or incorrect outputs. However, we persevered through this hardship, refining our code and prompts to achieve the desired results. This project strengthened the bonds between my group mates and me.</p>
                    <h2>Key Learning Points</h2>
