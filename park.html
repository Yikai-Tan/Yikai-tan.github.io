                    <h2>Aim of this Project</h2>
                    <p>The aim of this service project was to, make the park shine. Helping create a cleaner space for the community and to make the environment more livable and enjoyable for the community. This park was also used by children and thus we would like to try to remove hazards like sharp litter like glass shards. This service project was inplace to also help the cleaners who are working backbreaking hours to clean up after park users.</p>
                    <h2>Key Beneficiaries</h2>
                    <p>- Park users.</p>
                    <p>- Community Members</p>
                    <p>- Old folk using the parks to destress.</p>
                    <p>- Children using the playground in the park.</p>

                    <h2>Results of the project</h2>
                    <p>From this project we have collected a total of over 2 bags of dangerous trash like cigerates, glass shards from beer bottles and many more. The trash that was removed from the park by my class was disposed approprately and will prevent young children from getting hurt from these litter and trash. This not only preserves the environment and nature, but also helps the people who help cleanup after us have an easier time when cleaning up the parks.</p>
                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>This project showed me how dirty a community park can become and how singaporeans are very inconsiderate when the space is not their homes. This project also showed me how park users are very selfish and will not try to pick up litter that they see. Instead, choosing to ignore the litter and continuing to use the park. This project also taught me the importance of leadrship. During this project I was the vice chairperson of the class and had to give instructions to my classmates. This allowed me to make good descisions and allowed my class to clean up the entire park in under 2 hours.</p>
