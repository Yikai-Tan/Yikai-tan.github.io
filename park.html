                    <h2>Aim of this Project</h2>
                    <p>This service project aimed to make the park shine. We helped create a cleaner space for the community and made the environment more livable and enjoyable. Children also use this park. Thus, we tried to remove as many hazards as possible, such as sharp litter and glass shards. This service project was also in place to help the cleaners working backbreaking hours clean up after park users.</p>
                    <h2>Key Beneficiaries</h2>
                    <p>- Park users.</p>
                    <p>- Community Members</p>
                    <p>- Old folk using the parks to destress.</p>
                    <p>- Children using the playground in the park.</p>

                    <h2>Results of the project</h2>
                    <p>From this project, we have collected over two bags of dangerous trash. Some examples are cigarettes, glass shards from beer bottles, and many more. The garbage removed from the park by my class was disposed of appropriately and will prevent young children from getting hurt by this litter and trash. This not only preserves the environment and nature but also helps the people who help clean up after us have an easier time cleaning up the parks.</p>
                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>This project showed me how dirty a community park can become and how Singaporeans are inconsiderate when the space is not their home. This project also showed me how park users are very selfish and will not try to pick up litter that they see. Instead, choosing to ignore the litter and continue to use the park. This project also taught me the importance of leadership. During this project, I was the vice chairperson of the class and had to give instructions to my classmates. This allowed me to make good decisions and let my class clean up the entire park in under 2 hours.</p>
