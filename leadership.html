                        <p>During Secondary 3, I ran for vice chairperson. This allowed me to have a chance at handling a massive group of people and helping out the teachers in everyday tasks. This allowed me to hone my leadership skills as I have never led over 20 people. Class vice chairperson give me more responsibilities in the class and it allowed me to help out my peers and guide them wherever possible.</p>

This role not only gave me the opportunity to lead younger students by teaching them and pointing them in the right direction but it also allowed me to conduct my section to improve together as a team.</p>
