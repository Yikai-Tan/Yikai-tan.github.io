                        <p>During Secondary 3, I ran for vice chairperson. This allowed me to have a chance to handle a massive group of people and help out the teachers with everyday tasks. This allowed me to hone my leadership skills, as this is the first time I have led over 20 people. The class vice chairperson role gave me more responsibilities in the class, allowing me to help out my peers and guide them wherever possible.</p>

This role allowed me to lead younger students by teaching them, pointing them in the right direction, and conducting my section to improve together as a team.</p>
