                    <h2>Aim of this Project</h2>
                    <p>This service project aimed to help create a cleaner space for the community and make the environment more livable and enjoyable for the community. This service project was also in place to help the workers working backbreaking hours clean up after beachgoers.</p>
                    <h2>Key Beneficiaries</h2>
                    <p>- Park cleaners.</p>
                    <p>- Community Members</p>
                    <p>- Park and beach users.</p>

                    <h2>Results of the project</h2>
                    <p>From this project, we have collected a total of over 10kg of trash from the beach. The garbage we removed from the beach was disposed of properly and will not be coming to the sea anytime soon. This preserves the environment and helps the people who help clean up after us.</p>
                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>This project was an eye-opener, showing me how Singapore was not a 'clean' city but a 'clean' city. Many people are in the background cleaning up after us rather than us having the social etiquette of not littering and disposing of our trash properly. This project also showed me why teamwork is important. During this project, we could collect that much rubbish was accredited to the friends holding open the bags for us to throw rubbish into. After this project, I vow always to clean up and pick up litter on the ground when I see any.</p>
