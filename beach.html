                    <h2>Results of the project</h2>
                    <p>From this project we have collected a total of over 10kg worth of trash from the beach. The trash that was emoved from the beach by us was disposed properly and will not be making out to the sea anytime soon. This not only preserves the environment but also helps the people who help cleanup after us.</p>
                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>This project was an eye opener, showing me how singapore was not a 'clean' city but a 'cleaned' city. Many people are in the background cleaning up after us rather than us having the social etiqute of not littering and disposing of our trash properily. From this project, it also showed me why teamwork is important as during this project, we would not have been able to collect that much rubbish if it wasnt for the friends holding open the bags for us to throw rubbish into. After this project, I vow to always cleanup after myself and to pickup the litter on the ground when I see any.</p>
